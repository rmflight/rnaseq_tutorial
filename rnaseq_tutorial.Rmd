This RNASeq transcriptomics analysis will be carried out using R, a statistical programming language and interactive environment. I recommend using the RStudio interactive development environment, because it allows us to easily interact with R, and sets up “projects” that control where data is found.

## Included Data

Note that I've included some of the smaller files under the [data_files](data_files) directory so that it is easy to see what happens with some of the code down below.
The easiest way to get them is either by downloading directly, or cloning the entire project.

## Finding Data

We want to avoid having to do everything from scratch in this project for various reasons. Therefore, I recommend picking a dataset from either the ARCHS4 or recount2 projects, where all of the data has been preprocessed, and we simply need to download it and start working with it.

You should think about a disease or condition you might be interested in, and see if there are any datasets in ARCHS4 or recount2 that may be suitable. Make sure to make a list of experiment IDs or links to share with your mentor!

* ARCHS4 link: https://maayanlab.cloud/archs4/
* Recount2 link: https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount/

Discuss the possible data sets with your mentor before proceeding to attempt to download any data.

## Installing R & RStudio

We are going to use R, a data analysis programming language.
If you want to learn about using it in general, there are several good tutorials you can check out.

* [swirl](https://swirlstats.com/students.html): an interactive tutorial that runs within R itself.
* [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/): a book on general data processing. The HTML version of the book is free.
* [Teacup Giraffes](https://tinystats.github.io/teacups-giraffes-and-statistics/index.html): an introductory course that introduces running things in R and how to get some simple statistics out.

### Windows

[Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0PjTAylwoU)

Install R by downloading and running [this .exe file](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm) from CRAN. 
Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). 

### macOS

[Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-ly3kyxwEg)

Install R by downloading and running [this .pkg file](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-latest.pkg) from CRAN. 
Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). 

### Linux

You can download the binary files for your distribution from CRAN. Or you can use your package manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu `run sudo apt-get install r-base` and for Fedora run `sudo dnf install R`). 
Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). 

Please make sure your R installation works by starting RStudio. You should see a screen that looks like this:

![rstudio](images/RStudio-startup-screen.png)

This provides the Console, where R code is actually executed; Environment, displaying which objects are present; History, providing a history of which commands have been run; and several other panes you can read about elsewhere.

## Alternatives to RStudio

### VSCode

The only recommendation for another editor for working in R I've seen is for VSCode (unless you already use EMacs or Vim for everything. If that's you, you probably don't need my guidance).
There are some [guidelines to using R in VSCode](https://renkun.me/2019/12/11/writing-r-in-vscode-a-fresh-start/) by people who do it all the time.
I recommend checking out the above link or searching for VSCode and R to find more information.

## Installing Packages

R makes code available as packages. We will be using several hosted on CRAN (the official R package repository), as well as some from Bioconductor, and some written by Dr. Flight. Installing packages we use the command `install.packages("packageName")`.

For example, we can start by installing the "here" and "remotes" package, which will be used to install some other packages we will use. You can type the command below into the R console part of RStudio

```{r install_remotes, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("here")
install.packages("remotes")
```

Please type the command yourself, and don't copy paste! Typing it helps you to build proficiency and a muscle memory that will become further ingrained the more you do it.

Hopefully you didn't get any errors when you typed that in and pressed enter.
If you did get errors, they were likely something like:

```
Warning message:
package ‘rmotes’ is not available (for R version 4.0.0)
```

Or

```
Error in install.package("remotes") : 
  could not find function "install.package"
```

The first one means you spelled the package name wrong. 
The other one is telling you that you spelled the command wrong. 
These are very common errors especially when installing things. 
Some of the error messages from R are helpful, others less so. 
However, when there is an error, R is generally trying to be helpful, so do read them carefully, and google them if they are not obvious. 
Some are also collected here: https://rmflight.github.io/rerrors/

If it executed correctly, it should tell you at the end.

Other packages we will need to install include:

```{r install_necessary, eval = FALSE}
# provides really nice plotting abilities
install.packages("ggplot2") 
# provides access to biologically related packages in Bioconductor
install.packages("BiocManager") 
install.packages("dplyr")
```

We can then use `BiocManager` to install biologically related packages.

```{r install_bioconductor, eval = FALSE}
# loads BiocManager so you can use it
library(BiocManager) 
# runs the BiocManager command install
BiocManager::install("recount") 
# installs DEseq2 package
BiocManager::install("DEseq2") 
# installs a package used for quality control and analysis
remotes::install("MoseleyBioinformaticsLab/visualizationQualityControl")
remotes::install("rmflight/categoryCompare2")
```

While these are installing, you should notice lots of other packages being installed as well. 
Hopefully none of them are generating errors while they are installing.

### About Installation Commands

Some information on what we did above:

* `library()` is a function for loading up an installed package. The command `library` is the function, and you tell the function it's arguments with the brackets `()`. If you call the function name without `()`, R will actually print the function definition.
* `BiocManager` is a package for managing packages from the [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org) project.
* `BiocManager::install()` is calling the `install()` function from the `BiocManager` package. It is slightly faster than doing this:

```{r show_library_call, eval = FALSE}
library(BiocManager)
install("DEseq2")
```

* The `package::function()` only works if a package and it's dependencies are installed, obviously.
* It can be very useful when you know exactly what function you need, and you are only going to need one.
* It's also useful when there are several packages that have the same function name, you make sure you are calling the correct one.


## Creating a Project

Now we need to create our analysis project, where all of the data and code are going to live. You can create a new project using the “Projects” option on the global toolbar, it should be at the furthest right corner. More on using RStudio projects is available here: https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects

I recommend naming the project something memorable and informative.

Also, you should change two of the project options

```
Project 
  -> Project Options
  -> Restore .RData into workspace at startup -- “Never”
  -> Save workspace to .RData on exit -- “Never”
```

Many errors in analyses are caused by having old data loaded instead of starting from scratch. 
Therefore, to avoid having those kinds of issues, the options above should be enacted either globally or at the very least on each project.

**If you are not using RStudio**, then you should create a file named ".here" (see `r ?here::here`) in the directory where your project will be, and always start your session in that directory so that R knows your relative file paths.

## Downloading recount Data

Recount provides instructions on downloading data at https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount/

In short, you choose an identifier that corresponds to the data you want, say “SRX10000”, and ask recount to download it for you.

```{r download_data, eval = FALSE}
library('recount')
# make sure to change the STUDY ID to a real one!
url = download_study('SRX10000')
url 
# loading the data to work with it
load(file.path("SRX10000", "rse_gene.RData"))
``` 


Alternatively, you can download a data file corresponding to the lung data, and use it.
We will use this example file for all of our other example data processing.

```{r download_lung, eval = FALSE}
download.file("http://duffel.rail.bio/recount/v2/TCGA/rse_gene_lung.Rdata", destfile = here::here("data_files/rse_gene_lung.Rdata"))
```

Alternatively, you can download it using this link: http://duffel.rail.bio/recount/v2/TCGA/rse_gene_lung.Rdata

### Extract Useful Data

We want to extract both the original gene level counts, scaled counts, and information about the samples in the data. We do it this way to make some other things easier.

```{r extract_data, eval=FALSE}
library(recount)
load(here::here("data_files/rse_gene_lung.Rdata"))
gene_counts = assays(rse_gene)$counts
sample_data = colData(rse_gene)

# some of these are going to be specific to the TCGA data, I think
sample_info = data.frame(project = sample_data$project,
                         sample_id = sample_data$gdc_file_id,
                         gender = sample_data$gdc_cases.demographic.gender,
                         project_name = sample_data$gdc_cases.project.name,
                         race = sample_data$gdc_cases.demographic.race,
                         sample_type = sample_data$gdc_cases.samples.sample_type,
                         primary_site = sample_data$gdc_cases.project.primary_site,
                         tumor_stage = sample_data$gdc_cases.diagnoses.tumor_stage,
                         disease_type = sample_data$cgc_file_disease_type)

gene_data = rowRanges(rse_gene)
gene_info = as.data.frame(mcols(gene_data))

scaled_data = scale_counts(rse_gene)
scaled_counts = assays(scaled_data)$counts

saveRDS(gene_counts, file = here::here("data_files/recount_lung_original_counts.rds"))
saveRDS(sample_info, file = here::here("data_files/recount_lung_sample_info.rds"))
saveRDS(scaled_counts, file = here::here("data_files/recount_lung_scaled_counts.rds"))
saveRDS(gene_info, file = here::here("data_files/recount_lung_gene_info.rds"))
```

## Downloading ARCHS4 Data

For ARCHS4, we download the full data set (human is 12 GB, mouse is probably larger), and then subset it by samples of interest.

```{r get_archs4, eval = FALSE}
destination_file = here::here("data_files/archs4_human_matrix_v9.h5")
extracted_expression_file = here::here("data_files/archs4_LUNG_expression_matrix.tsv")
url = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/mssm-seq-matrix/human_matrix_v9.h5"

# Check if gene expression file was already downloaded, if not in current directory download file form repository
if(!file.exists(destination_file)){
    print("Downloading compressed gene expression matrix.")
    download.file(url, destination_file, quiet = FALSE, mode = 'wb')
}
```

### Getting Useful Data Out


```{r archs4_useful, eval = FALSE}
lung_samples = readLines(here::here("data_files/archs4_lung_samplelist.txt"))

library("rhdf5")
human_file = here::here("data_files/archs4_human_matrix_v9.h5")
# you can see what is in the file
h5ls(human_file)

samples = h5read(human_file, "meta/samples/geo_accession")
genes = h5read(human_file, "meta/genes/genes")
titles = h5read(human_file, "meta/samples/title")
series = h5read(human_file, "meta/samples/series_id")

sample_locations = which(samples %in% lung_samples)
expression = t(h5read(human_file, "data/expression", index=list(sample_locations, 1:length(genes))))

colnames(expression) = samples[sample_locations]
rownames(expression) = genes

sample_info = data.frame(sample_id = samples[sample_locations],
                         title = titles[sample_locations],
                         series = series[sample_locations])

saveRDS(expression, here::here("data_files/archs4_lung_counts.rds")_
saveRDS(sample_info, here::here("data_files/archs4_lung_sample_info.rds"))
```

### Notes on Saving & Reloading Data

In contrast to lots of tutorials where they recommend saving data using `save()`, I prefer `saveRDS()`. 
The reason is because `readRDS()` makes you assign the object to a new name, and that name can be whatever makes sense to you.
`load()` will load the data with whatever name it had previously, which can be very, very annoying, especially for an analysis like this.
So for example, if we want, we can load the `sample_info` we saved above with a different name:

```{r load_example, eval = FALSE}
info = readRDS(here::here("data_files/archs4_lung_sample_info.rds"))
```

## Running An Analysis

OK, so we have data from RNA-seq transcriptomics experiments.
What exactly happened to get this far?

* Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) was extracted from cells
* High abundance RNAs were removed (probably)
  * Why would we do this? Which RNA would be in high abundance? (Hint: the machinery to translate mRNA also contains RNA)
* Converted to DNA
* Amplified using PCR
* Sequenced, probably using some form of next-generation sequencing
* Those sequences are then aligned to a reference genome
* And then how many sequences align to each part of the genome give us the counts above

### Determining Useful Samples & Subsampling

Depending on your computer's RAM (random access memory), you may or may not be able to analyze all genes or samples at the same time, and if you tried to run the ARCHS4 extraction code above, you may have run out of RAM, and either had the process take forever, or had your computer crash completely.

**Let your mentor know if your computer crashed and you still want to use ARCHS4 data!!**

One thing we can do to reduce the compute requirements, and at least work out what code is going to work, is to:

* Subset to a more relevant set of samples, which is likely necessary unless you are working with a rather simple single study.
* Subset to a more manageable set of genes and/or samples.

#### Useful Samples

Let's see if we can subset the recount samples to something more reasonable than **all** of the samples.

```{r useful_recount}
library(dplyr)
lung_info = readRDS(here::here("data_files/recount_lung_sample_info.rds"))

knitr::kable(head(lung_info))
```

We can see from the table that we have a bunch of useful information:

* sample_id: a sample id, that corresponds to the column names of our expression data
* gender: what gender was the sample from
* project_name: some information about the project
* race: what race of a person is the sample from
* sample_type: what type of sample is it
* primary_site: where is it thought that the primary tumor is from
* tumor_stage: what stage is the tumor at
* disease_type: what type of disease is it

We can also get an idea of what is in the data asking what the unique values of each column are.
The data we have is a data.frame, which is really a list underneath, so we can iterate over specific pieces using `purrr`.

```{r table_summary}
dplyr::select(lung_info, gender, project_name, race, sample_type, primary_site, tumor_stage, disease_type) %>%
  purrr::iwalk(., function(.x, .y){
    message(.y)
    print(unique(.x))
  })
```

Using this information, we can start to think about how to slice and dice the data.
For example, we probably want to use only one type of lung cancer, and there are two types here.
We also want to work with primary tumors only, and also those that are from a higher stage.

We start with `r nrow(lung_info)` total samples.

```{r filter_samples}
small_lung = dplyr::filter(lung_info, 
                           disease_type == "Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma",
                           !(tumor_stage %in% c("not reported", "stage ia", "stage i", "stage ib")),
                           !(sample_type %in% c("Recurrent Tumor")))
```

This gives us `r nrow(small_lung)` samples.
Lets verify that we only have what we want:

```{r double_check_filter}
dplyr::select(small_lung, disease_type, tumor_stage, sample_type) %>%
  purrr::iwalk(., function(.x, .y){
    message(.y)
    print(unique(.x))
  })
```

We also need to add something that is a bit more useful as an identifier of "normal" and "cancerous" tissue.

```{r label_cancer_normal}
small_lung = dplyr::mutate(
  small_lung,
  disease = dplyr::case_when(
    grepl("Tumor", sample_type) ~ "cancer",
    grepl("Normal", sample_type) ~ "normal"
  ))

unique(small_lung$disease)

table(small_lung$disease)
```

So, severely unbalanced, with `r sum(grepl("cancer", small_lung$disease))` and only `r sum(grepl("normal", small_lung$disease))`.

But now we can make a smaller version of the lung data with just these samples.

```{r make_small_data}
# we have to transform this to upper because that is what is on the matrix
small_lung = dplyr::mutate(small_lung, sample_id2 = toupper(sample_id))
lung_matrix = readRDS(here::here("data_files/recount_lung_original_counts.rds"))

small_matrix = lung_matrix[, small_lung$sample_id2]
dim(small_matrix)
saveRDS(small_lung, file = here::here("data_files/small_lung_info.rds"))
saveRDS(small_matrix, file = here::here("data_files/small_lung_original_counts.rds"))
```

In addition to using the smaller set of samples, we can also select a smaller set of genes.
We will look first for those that have a non-zero value in at least one sample.
And then we will take a random sample of those.

```{r subsample_small, eval = FALSE}
set.seed(1234)
is_1 = purrr::map_lgl(seq(1, nrow(small_matrix)), function(in_row){
  sum(small_matrix[in_row, ] > 0) > 0
})
use_rows = sample(which(is_1), 1000)
sub_lung = small_matrix[use_rows, ]

scaled_lung = readRDS(here::here("data_files/recount_lung_scaled_counts.rds"))
small_scaled = scaled_lung[, small_lung$sample_id2]
sub_scaled = small_scaled[use_rows, ]
saveRDS(sub_lung, file = here::here("data_files/sub_lung_original_counts.rds"))

saveRDS(small_scaled, file = here::here("data_files/small_lung_scaled_counts.rds"))
saveRDS(sub_scaled, file = here::here("data_files/sub_lung_scaled_counts.rds"))
```

This is really, really useful, because if you are having memory problems with the full set, then you can use the much smaller subset to test your code with, work it all out, and then run the code somewhere else with more memory available.

### Quality Control / Quality Assurance

Quality control and quality assurance means we are looking for things that don't fit with the others.
We can use correlation amongst the samples to check if they match each other and see if something doesn't fit.

```{r load_data}
library(visualizationQualityControl)
library(ggplot2)
sub_lung = readRDS(here::here("data_files/sub_lung_scaled_counts.rds"))
sub_info = readRDS(here::here("data_files/small_lung_info.rds"))
```

#### Correlation

We use a special correlation that is able to incorporate missing values when it calculates a pairwise ranked correlation.

```{r med_cor, eval = FALSE}
library(furrr)
plan(multicore)
sample_cor = visqc_ici_kendallt(t(sub_lung))

saveRDS(sample_cor, file = here::here("data_files/sub_lung_cor.rds"))
```

```{r load_saved_cor}
sample_cor = readRDS(here::here("data_files/sub_lung_cor.rds"))
med_cor = median_correlations(sample_cor$cor, sub_info$disease)

ggplot(med_cor, aes(x = med_cor)) + geom_histogram() + 
  facet_wrap(~ sample_class, ncol = 1)
```

In this plot, we've plotted the distributions of the median correlations for both of the cancer and the normal samples.
Notice that in each of these, there is at least one outlier sample.
We can also see that the "normal" distribution is in general higher than the "cancer" distribution.

We could also look at these in a heatmap, and we would probably see that each of these would have different correlations to the others.

#### Outlier Fraction

```{r out_frac}
out_frac = outlier_fraction(t(sub_lung), sub_info$disease)

ggplot(out_frac, aes(x = frac)) + geom_histogram() + 
  facet_wrap(~ sample_class, ncol = 1)
```

These are not nearly as clear cut.

#### Combine

We can combine these two scores and look for outliers within the combined score, for each of "normal" and "cancer".

```{r find_outliers}
outliers = determine_outliers(med_cor, out_frac)

ggplot(outliers, aes(x = score, fill = outlier)) + 
  geom_histogram(position = "identity") +
  facet_wrap(~ sample_class.frac, ncol = 1)
```
